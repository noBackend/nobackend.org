    Inspired by the wonderfull <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>,
    we created an example invoicing app that is implemented
    using today's noBackend solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's based on Chris Coyier's <a href="http://css-tricks.com/editable-invoice-v2/">Editable Invoice</a>,
    that he created back in 2009 as a showcase for an HTML-only app.
    We've tweaked the design a bit, and also added features that
    typically require a backend: User Accounts, Exports, Emails.
